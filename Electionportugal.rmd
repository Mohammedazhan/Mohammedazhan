***The target variable Final Mandate has 18 levels so we classified into Two category given below***

1. Low - If the  Final Mandates less than  or equal to 20

1. High - If the Final Mandates greater than 20


```{r}

# Numerical Summary

 ***A numerical summary is a number used to describe a specific characteristic about a data set.***

***We will go over the theory and application of the following numerical summaries we have taken mean,median,standard deviation & variance***

1. Mean - The mean adds up all the data values and divides by the total number of values

1. Median- This is the “middle data point”, where half of the data is below the median and half is above the median.

1. Standard Deviation - Standard deviation is extensively used in statistics and data science. It measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a data set, calculating how spread out the data are from the mean. 

  A "Deviation" is defined as the distance an observation lies from the reference point

1. Variance- Variance is almost the same calculation of the standard deviation, but it stays in squared units. So, if you take the square root of the variance, you have the standard deviation.

1. Count - Count the number of occurrences.

## summary of pre.subscribed Voters

```{r}
pre_subvt=ed %>%
  group_by(FinalMandates_1) %>% summarise(avg=mean(pre.subscribedVoters),minimum=max(pre.subscribedVoters),maximum=min(pre.subscribedVoters),standard_deviation=sd(pre.subscribedVoters))
kbl(pre_subvt) %>% kable_styling(full_width=T)

```

***Based on average if pre blank vote increases there is a chance that final mandates will also increase***

## Summary of pre.totalVoters

```{r}
pre_totvt=ed %>% 
  group_by(FinalMandates_1) %>% summarise(avg=mean(pre.totalVoters),minimum=min(pre.totalVoters),maximum=max(pre.totalVoters),standard_deviation=sd(pre.totalVoters))
kbl(pre_totvt) %>% kable_styling(full_width=T)
```

***Based on average values we can see that, if pre blank vote increases there is a chance that final mandates will also increase***

## Summary of num parishes

```{r}
np=ed %>% 
  group_by(FinalMandates_1) %>% summarise(avg=mean(numParishes),minimum=min(numParishes),maximum=max(numParishes),standard_deviation=sd(numParishes))

```

***Based on average values we can see that, if numParishes increases there is a chance that final mandates will also increase***

## summary of num parishes approved


```{r}

  group_by(FinalMandates_1) %>% summarise(avg=mean(numParishesApproved),minimum=min(numParishesApproved),maximum=max(numParishesApproved),standard=sd(numParishesApproved))
kbl(np_ap) %>% kable_styling(full_width=T)
```

***Based on average values we can see that, if numParishesApproved increases there is a chance that final mandates will also increase***

## Summary of current subscribed Voters(2019)

```{r}
sub_per=ed %>% 
  group_by(FinalMandates_1) %>% summarise(avg=mean(subscribedVoters),minimum=min(subscribedVoters),maximum=max(subscribedVoters),standard=sd(subscribedVoters))

***Based on average values we can see that, if subscribedVoters increases there is a chance that final mandates will also increase***

# correlation plots

***correlation ranges from -1 to +1 , Negative values of correlation indicate that as one variable increases the other variable decreases . Positive value of correlation indicate that the one variable increase and other variable will also increase.***

   ***We have selected variables which have high correlation with the Final mandates*** 
  
   ***The variables used for correlation plot are given below***
   
1. numParishes

1. numParishesApproved

1. totalVoters


1. Votes

# Final mandate Vs territory_region

```{r}
#ed%>%
  #group_by(territory_region) %>%
 # do(p=plot_ly(.,  y = ~FinalMandates,color=~territory_region,colors="Set2",
            #   type = "box")) %>%
 # subplot(nrows = 1,  shareY = TRUE)
ggplot(ed, aes(x =FinalMandates , y =territory_region )) +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(fill = territory_region)) +
  theme(legend.position = "")
```

***From the above plot we came to know that all the regions are in right skew most value lies below 20 From Final Mandates***

# Final mandate_1 VS total voters

```{r}

#   previous total votes Vs totalMandates

```{r}
ph5=plot_ly(ed,x=~pre.totalVoters,y=~totalMandates,type="scatter",mode="markers")
ph5
```

***From the above plot we came to  know that , if pre total voters increases total mandate is also getting increased***

# numParishes Vs FinalMandates

```{r}

          add = "mean",
          color = "FinalMandates_1", fill = "FinalMandates_1",
          palette = c("darkgreen", "yellow","blue","red"))
```

***From the above plot we came to know that Final mandates is likely to be high if numparishes is increasing*** 


# Final Note

 1. We taken Portugal election data for Analyzing in Which we found that this data is of election held on 06 October 2019 in 21 territories and 27 party participated in the election
 
 1. In this data set we have taken Final Mandate as target variable which defines the winner in election results with this variable we are going to analyze how it differs in previous election and current election
 
 1. In territories variable we have 21 territories we have categorized it into four major areas which we named as "North", "South","Central","West"
 
 1. In Final Mandate we have 18 level so we have classified into Four category "Low Votes" ,"Medium Votes", "High Votes" and "other" 

1. some of insights are given below

1. numParishes
1. numParishesApprove
1. pre.subscribedVoters
1. Votes
1. subscribedVoters
